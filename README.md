Chronic acne status tracking

## Problem 1: Tracking

- Existing managed solutions, have these problems:
  - Bad form factor
  - Require excessive customization
  - Lack visualizations
  - Fail to motivate committment
  - Try to sell things to me
  
Ad-hoc tracking solutions suffer from all but the last of those problems.

## Problem 2: Information

- I can't make accurately informed lifestyle decisions that help me to self-treat my condition.

*Why?*

- I don't understand the cause-and-effect relationships involved in acne pathogenesis.

*Why?*

- There is a lot of conflicting information online. 
I am not a medical expert, and I struggle to reliably go beyond face-value evaluations of sources of information.
