Track your skin's breakouts

## Problem: Outbreak Tracking

When it came to my skin, I always found it hard to answer these questions:

- Is my skin actually getting better?
- Are my pet theories about my skin actually true, or could they be disproved by actually recording data about my skin's
  health over time?

Existing managed solutions, have these problems:

- Bad form factor
- Require excessive customization
- Lack visualizations
- Try to sell things to me

Ad-hoc tracking solutions suffer from all but the last of those problems. I never used an ad-hoc tracking solution because of their main
problem: Like many ad-hoc solutions in general, they are high-effort, low-reward.

## Solution: SkinTracker

This app allows me to answer the above questions by making it easy to record appropriate subjective data. It does not
attempt to perform "intelligent" correlation of outputs (e.g. skin health) to the vast array of possible inputs (diet,
sleep, medication, pillow cases, clothes, hair, stress etc.). Instead, it gives me the ability to track just the outputs,
and leaves me to make my own conclusions about any correlation to the inputs.
